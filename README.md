The circle ci has the below steps 
  Step: Setting up a CircleCI pipeline using the aws-ecr orb - circleci/aws-ecr@7.0.0
        The aws-ecr orb comes prepackaged with commands to:
        Build an image
        Tag the image (using the Git commit hash of the HEAD == CIRCLE_SHA1 )
        Login to Amazon ECR
        Create an Amazon ECR repo, if one doesnâ€™t exist
        Push an image to Amazon ECR

        we need pass the below details 
        Amazon ECR account URL that maps to an AWS account, e.g. {awsAccountNum}.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
        AWS access key id of cicd iam user
        AWS secret key of cicd iam user
        AWS region where your ECR resources will be located.
        dockerfile which required to create image

Once this step executed it builds image using docker file and it pushes the image to docker repository which we provided in the aws-ecr orb configuration.
